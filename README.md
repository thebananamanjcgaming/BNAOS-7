# Welcome to BNAOS!
This will be a short one, so just beware!
# What is BNAOS?
BNAOS is a Windows 7 emulator with simulated GUI elements in HTML5!

It also utilizes BoxedWine and x86Box Manager to work!

Before Aero Glass update (latest):

It has the ability to translate JIT to WASM, translate certain 64-bit Windows 7/98 binaries, and even more!

But just know, this is NOT a replacement for your OS, it's just a minimal "workstation" for computing needs that MacOS users and Linux users don't get.
# What can it currently emulate?
It currently emulates Windows 7 SP2 build 7600, duh.

<i>NOTE: OPENING VIA LOCALHOST OR VIA THE DEPLOYMENT(S) LISTED IS NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED, AS SOME SIZING, COLORING, AND SCRIPTING ISSUES CAN OCCUR!</i>
